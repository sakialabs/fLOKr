# fLOKR Gamification

## Core principles

A system that enhances dignity, not dopamine. Gamifying care, contribution, and continuity, not attention. No streak pressure. No addiction loops. Progress should feel earned and calm.

## Badge system (meaningful, not cringe)

### Arrival & Belonging

- **First Landing** – completed first reservation
- **Settled In** – used 3 different essentials
- **Found My Flock** – connected with 2 community members

### Contribution & Care

- **Warm Hands** – donated clothing
- **Open Pantry** – shared food items
- **Tool Ally** – shared tools or equipment
- **Reliable Wing** – returned items on time consistently

### Community Energy

- **Welcomer** – welcomed 5 newcomers
- **Connector** – introduced two people
- **Community Builder** – hosted or supported an event

### Steward & Trust

- **Steady Wing** – steward-approved reliable member
- **Hub Anchor** – consistent support at a specific hub

Badges should unlock soft privileges, not power.

## Levels (rename them, don't call them levels)

Tie them to birds and migration, subtly.

1. Newcomer
2. Nesting
3. Grounded
4. Trusted Wing
5. Flock Anchor

These are status signals, not ranks.

## Ori AI as the gentle guide

Ori shouldn't shout. Ori should notice.

Examples:

- "Ori noticed you've helped a lot lately. Thank you."
- "Ori suggests winter boots are in high demand this week."
- "Ori thinks you might like welcoming someone new."

Ori rewards behavior by naming it, not gamifying it aggressively.

## Micro-rewards (quiet but effective)

- Subtle confetti only on firsts
- Gentle copy, never fireworks
- Occasional handwritten-style messages:
  - "This mattered."
  - "Someone benefited from this."

Those hit harder than points.

## Seasonal migrations

Every season, the community works toward a shared goal:

- "Winter Warmth Drive"
- "Spring Reset"
- "Back-to-School Support"

Progress is collective. Rewards are collective. That's flock energy.

## What to avoid at all costs

- Leaderboards by default
- Public shaming or rankings
- Like counts on posts
- Daily streaks

Those break trust fast.

## Final thoughts

The app doesn't need to make people compete.

It needs to help them feel useful, seen, and safe.

Ori the oriole guiding people as they land, help, and stay grounded is a strong narrative thread. You're building a place, not a game. And ironically, that's what makes it engaging.
